# PPM-of-Neutron-star-Unveiling-hot-spot-geometry
In this project, I focus on analyzing NICER observations of a small sample of systems known as isolated pulsars, which emit periodic pulses. This includes calibrating the data and obtaining energy-resolved pulse profiles. Understand and apply PPM using X-PSI.
